# Industrial-Works-BMS-Design

This project showcases a Battery Management System (BMS) Controller designed using PADs PCB design software, featuring the Texas Instruments TMS320F28335 DSP — a high-performance controller commonly used in motor control and power electronics.

Despite the tight schedule and limited scope, I successfully completed the design of a multi-layer PCB tailored for industrial-grade battery management applications.
Check out PDF file to see layers and my routing.

## Key Highlights

- Processor: TI TMS320F28335 Digital Signal Processor (DSP)

- Application: BMS (Battery Management System) controller for industrial or automotive use

- Tool: PADs PCB Design Suite (Mentor Graphics)

- Design Focus: High-current routing, mixed-signal layout, signal integrity, and power plane optimization
